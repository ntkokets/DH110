## Assignment 5: Low Fidelity Prototype

Nathan Koketsu | DH 110 | Spring 2023

### Introduction

The primary focus of this project is to address the need for grocery list apps to inform users about the dietary restrictions of people close to them, namely family members. A key defining characteristic of the target audience members is that they have a consistent responsibility to provide food for their family, often encountering barriers such as a lack of technological understanding or a lack of time. However, for the purposes of testing, the insights of anyone who can use the functions of the app can prove useful.

The purpose of this low-fidelity prototype is to test whether my implementation of specific features in the app is intuitive for people who would be expected to use it. Through this, I hope to receive feedback to bring into later iterations of the design while avoiding the potentially wasted time of creating refined features with inherent flaws.

### Supported Tasks

These tasks were based on findings from contextual inquiry and usability testing of an existing app called Errands To-Do List. They are intended to incorporate new capabilities while keeping any working design elements from Errands.

1. Adding new friends to profile. Note that users can add their dietary restrictions to their personal profile
2. Linking friends to an existing grocery list
3. Implementing a suggested grocery for a grocery list
