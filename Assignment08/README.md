# Diet-Conscious Grocery Shopping App

## Nathan Koketsu | DH 110 | Spring 2023

### Introduction

The goal of this project is to foster connections between family members by focusing on the area of culinary traditions. This app specifically centers the task of grocery shopping, which is ongoing within a family and often needs to accommodate different diets and dietary restrictions.

### Design Statement

To address the problem of communicating dietary restrictions within a family and consistently accounting for them in grocery shopping, this app aims to create a simple way for shoppers to be informed about the groceries they buy and how those items fit with existing restrictions.

### Competitor Analysis

### High-Fidelity Prototype

This stage of the design process combined the design system and low-fidelity prototypes to create an digital interactive prototype of the app. Users offered critique based on their cognitive walkthrough of the prototype. For example, they observed issues in using the "linked friends" feature in the prototype.
