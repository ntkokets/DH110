# Diet-Conscious Grocery Shopping App

## Nathan Koketsu | DH 110 | Spring 2023

### Introduction

The goal of this project is to foster connections between family members by focusing on the area of culinary traditions. This app specifically centers the task of grocery shopping, which is ongoing within a family and often needs to accommodate different diets and dietary restrictions.

### Design Statement

To address the problem of communicating dietary restrictions within a family and consistently accounting for them in grocery shopping, this app aims to create a simple way for shoppers to be informed about the groceries they buy and how those items fit with existing restrictions.

### Competitor Analysis

Heuristic evaluation and usability testing of existing products that offer similar features to the intended app (Errands and FitDay)

### User Research

This step involved interviewing a person in the intended target audience for the product to gain insights on their habits and greatest needs for an app that improves a user's grocery shopping experience.

### UX Storytelling

Once the user research was complete, I developed user personas to match different profiles within the target audience and how the app can meet their needs.

## Wireframe and Graphic Design Element Variation

In this stage, I refined the design system for the app by trying out different colors, shapes, layouts, and typography, eventually settling on an initial design system.

### Low-Fidelity Prototype

The low-fidelity prototype stage involved sketching a rough version of the interface and allowing a user to map their process of "using" the sketched app.

### High-Fidelity Prototype

This stage of the design process combined the design system and low-fidelity prototypes to create an digital interactive prototype of the app. Users offered critique based on their cognitive walkthrough of the prototype. For example, they observed issues in using the "linked friends" feature in the prototype.
