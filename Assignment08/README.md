# Diet-Conscious Grocery Shopping App

## Nathan Koketsu | DH 110 | Spring 2023

### Introduction

The goal of this project is to foster connections between family members by focusing on the area of culinary traditions. This app specifically centers the task of grocery shopping, which is ongoing within a family and often needs to accommodate different diets and dietary restrictions.

### Design Statement

To address the problem of communicating dietary restrictions within a family and consistently accounting for them in grocery shopping, this app aims to create a simple way for shoppers to be informed about the groceries they buy and how those items fit with existing restrictions.

> *Errands To-Do List app*

This stage involved heuristic evaluation and usability testing of existing products that offer similar features to the intended app. For this project, the apps Errands To-Do List and FitDay were assessed for any positive features and areas of improvement.

This step involved interviewing a person in the intended target audience for the product to gain insights on their habits and greatest needs for an app that improves a user's grocery shopping experience.

Once the user research was complete, this stage involved developing user personas to match different profiles within the target audience and how the app can meet their needs.

### Low-Fidelity Prototype

The low-fidelity prototype stage involved sketching a rough version of the interface and allowing a user to map their process of "using" the sketched app.

This stage involved refining the design system for the app by trying out different colors, shapes, layouts, and typography, eventually settling on an initial design system.

### High-Fidelity Prototype

This stage of the design process combined the design system and low-fidelity prototypes to create an digital interactive prototype of the app. Users offered critique based on their cognitive walkthrough of the prototype. For example, they observed issues in using the "linked friends" feature in the prototype.

### Pitch Video

### Conclusion

One of my most important takeaways from this process was the importance of involving other opinions throughout the process of designing an app. There were many instances where feedback from others drew my attention to needing changes in the app that I did not previously notice. Additionally, I better understood the reasons behind the use of multiple design iterations since I found necessary updates to the design after creating my first high-fidelity prototype, even after the previous steps from beforehand. Often, some become most visible once users can interact with the app itself, and there are new features that will need to be further researched and tested if the app expands its functionality. This means that a UX team needs to continually improve and conduct testing on their designs, which is very insightful to experience firsthand.
