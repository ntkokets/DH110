# Centralized Activities and Communication for Families
## Assignment 1: Heuristic Evaluation
Today, a wide variety of technology is available to stay in contact with loved ones, but this can often be a point of frustration and confusion for older generations, as switching between apps can be unrealistic for those living at long distances from each other. For instance, if family members want to participate in an online activity together, they may need to access a website outside of their video conferencing app, which can be daunting for older generations while younger, more technologically-savvy family members may grow impatient with these interactions. The goal of this project is to create a centralized way for all members of a family to easily communicate via messaging or video conferencing and access other apps such as games or entertainment that connect to this experience, making group activities simpler for long-distance families.

### Review of Jakob Nielsen's [10 Usability Heuristics](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/)

1. Visibility of system status: indicate what is currently happening in their interaction with the system
2. Match between system and the real world: implement communication elements that meet a user’s understanding
3. User control and freedom: provide ways for users to back out of unwanted actions
4. Consistency and standards: ensure consistency of certain meanings within the platform and follow industry conventions
5. Error prevention: either eliminate conditions that can lead to errors or provide confirmation messages to minimize both unconscious slips and conscious mistakes
6. Recognition rather than recall: avoid situations where users need to remember information from one interface to another and allow people to recognize information in the interface
7. Flexibility and efficiency of use: include shortcuts, personalization, and customization features to accommodate both inexperienced and experienced users
8. Aesthetic and minimalist design: ensure that the UI is focused on the essentials to a user’s experience rather than adding irrelevant or unnecessary information
9. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors: pair recognizable visuals with plain language to help users identify errors and take next steps to solve the problem
10. Help and documentation: provide concise documentation to help users take concrete steps for a task

### Review of Nielsen's [Severity Ratings](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-to-rate-the-severity-of-usability-problems/)
| Rating | Description |
|---|---|
| 1 | *Cosmetic problem only: need not be fixed unless extra time is available on project* |
| 2 | *Minor usability problem: fixing this should be given low priority* |
| 3 | *Major usability problem: important to fix, so should be given high priority* |

Note: Severity ratings are provided in parentheses next to each usability issue observed.

## Website 1: [Gather](https://www.gather.town/)
Gather allows multiple long-distance users to create avatars to simulate interaction with other people in an online environment. By default, users are able to approach other avatars, activating video conferencing and messaging options, and administrators of a space can include activities such as games within certain areas of the virtual space.
