Nathan Koketsu | DH 110 | Spring 2023

### Review of Jakob Nielsen's [10 Usability Heuristics](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/)

1. Visibility of system status: indicate what is currently happening in their interaction with the system
2. Match between system and the real world: implement communication elements that meet a user’s understanding
3. User control and freedom: provide ways for users to back out of unwanted actions
4. Consistency and standards: ensure consistency of certain meanings within the platform and follow industry conventions
5. Error prevention: either eliminate conditions that can lead to errors or provide confirmation messages to minimize both unconscious slips and conscious mistakes
6. Recognition rather than recall: avoid situations where users need to remember information from one interface to another and allow people to recognize information in the interface
7. Flexibility and efficiency of use: include shortcuts, personalization, and customization features to accommodate both inexperienced and experienced users
8. Aesthetic and minimalist design: ensure that the UI is focused on the essentials to a user’s experience rather than adding irrelevant or unnecessary information
9. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors: pair recognizable visuals with plain language to help users identify errors and take next steps to solve the problem
10. Help and documentation: provide concise documentation to help users take concrete steps for a task

### Review of Nielsen's [Severity Ratings](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-to-rate-the-severity-of-usability-problems/)
| Rating | Description |
|---|---|
| 1 | *Cosmetic problem only: need not be fixed unless extra time is available on project* |
| 2 | *Minor usability problem: fixing this should be given low priority* |
| 3 | *Major usability problem: important to fix, so should be given high priority* |
