# Centralized Activities and Communication for Families
## Assignment 1: Heuristic Evaluation
Over time, food and cuisine has continued to bring families together and allow for genuine connections between family members. The opportunity to cook together and share recipes is one that can be enjoyed by both younger and older members of families, representing a passing on of traditions and culture. At the same time, there is growing consciousness of diet-related preferences and conditions experienced within families as well as a variety of ingredients that can be purchased to accommodate these preferences or needs. While the Internet makes it possible to search recipes that use ingredients and groceries according to these dietary needs, the interpersonal family dynamic of sharing recipes can often be lost in the midst of constantly searching for new ones. The goal of this project is to provide a streamlined, simple way to accommodate the specific diets of family members in tandem with the sharing of culinary traditions within families.

### Review of Jakob Nielsen's [10 Usability Heuristics](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/)

1. Visibility of system status: indicate what is currently happening in their interaction with the system
2. Match between system and the real world: implement communication elements that meet a user’s understanding
3. User control and freedom: provide ways for users to back out of unwanted actions
4. Consistency and standards: ensure consistency of certain meanings within the platform and follow industry conventions
5. Error prevention: either eliminate conditions that can lead to errors or provide confirmation messages to minimize both unconscious slips and conscious mistakes
6. Recognition rather than recall: avoid situations where users need to remember information from one interface to another and allow people to recognize information in the interface
7. Flexibility and efficiency of use: include shortcuts, personalization, and customization features to accommodate both inexperienced and experienced users
8. Aesthetic and minimalist design: ensure that the UI is focused on the essentials to a user’s experience rather than adding irrelevant or unnecessary information
9. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors: pair recognizable visuals with plain language to help users identify errors and take next steps to solve the problem
10. Help and documentation: provide concise documentation to help users take concrete steps for a task

### Review of Nielsen's [Severity Ratings](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-to-rate-the-severity-of-usability-problems/)
| Rating | Description |
|---|---|
| 1 | *Cosmetic problem only: need not be fixed unless extra time is available on project* |
| 2 | *Minor usability problem: fixing this should be given low priority* |
| 3 | *Major usability problem: important to fix, so should be given high priority* |

Note: Severity ratings are provided in parentheses next to each usability issue observed.
