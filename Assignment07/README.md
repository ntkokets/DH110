## Assignment 7: High-Fidelity Prototype

Nathan Koketsu | DH 110 | Spring 2023

### Introduction

This project aims to create an app that improves the experience of grocery shopping when keeping dietary restrictions in mind. The goal is to create easy-to-use interface and implement features such as adding friends in order to easily share these dietary restrictions. The purpose of creating a high-fidelity prototype is to more closely show a finalized version of the designed app, which users can interact with as if the app was already completed. This can allow for better insights into any usability issues with the design, which may call for reiterations of previous steps in the design process. Additionally, users have the opportunity to interact with a prototype that has a design system applied, allowing them to make critiques accordingly.

### Supported Tasks

1. The first supported task is adding a new friend to the user's account
2. The second supported task is linking a new friend to a grocery list, allowing the app to compare their dietary restrictions to the list
3. The third supported task is replacing or adding grocery recommendations to a list according to flagged items that are restricted for some people

The previous high-fidelity prototype design is linked [here](https://www.figma.com/file/L2d58HCUBJ2TxBWPvfsTPY/High-Fidelity-Prototype-(Initial-Design)?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&t=6UJ4677xtXa7VpSa-1).

> Due to Autoflow limitations, some back flows are omitted. Notably, the previous iteration has a different background color and uses less color overall. Some frames have also been replaced with overlays or deleted altogether.

I found the cognitive walkthrough process to be very insightful. While I had the chance to gather feedback for the low-fidelity prototype and design system, I think this stage provided the most information for future iterations of the app, where I return to previous steps of the design process to refine my work. The process for testing some of the features such as adding a new friend went relatively smoothly according to my expectation, as well as replacing an item on a list based on the app's recommendation. For these tasks, the placement of icons such as arrows created a relatively intuitive flow. However, it was more difficult for the participant to link friends due to a lack of a specific button for this, which I did not anticipate when initially creating the high-fidelity prototype.

One point of feedback was that the app did not appear professional in its aesthetics or color schemes and that the icons and text seem overly big. I was not able to address this feedback in its entirety since I would have to reassess my design system, but I decided to change my color scheme by adding a new secondary color and adding the focus color to new portions of the screen. I did not expect this feedback since responses to the initial design system did not indicate this. However, I have learned that it is important to view the interface from the screen it will be used on (in this case, an iPhone 8), as this would give a better indication of whether some icons and text are too large. In the future, I would use smaller text for some of the buttons such as "Edit" and "New Folder" as well as alter the folder icons to avoid the boxy outline look, which may mean replacing the component designs.

Another important point of feedback was that the steps to perform certain tasks such as adding linked friends. During the cognitive walkthrough, the participant had a difficult time in identifying the meaning of the small profile icons attached to the lists. I found that this was not an effective way to link friends with lists without some other mechanism to do so. Therefore, I would alternatively design a dropdown menu for each list which would include a specific button to link friends, for which the appearance of icons can be a visual update to the lists after this is done. Additionally, I would add and change other icons such as implementing a hamburger menu for added ease in navigating the app settings and profile information. Unfortunately, many of the changes, such as making all buttons active and adding completely new features was not realistic, but I will take note of these necessary changes for future iterations of the app design, which would refine it further.
