## Assignment 6: Interface Design

Nathan Koketsu | DH 110 | Spring 2023

### Introduction
The goal of this project is to improve communication about dietary restrictions to inform grocery buying as well as organize and expedite the process of forming grocery lists. The app is designed to allow people to connect in a way similar to apps like Venmo while sharing specific information about their specific dietary restrictions. This project is very helpful after creating a wireflow since it allows for further refinement on the visual design side of the website. By trying out different iterations, it is helpful to find the most effective designs.

### Digitized Wireflow and Interface Design Page
Both the digitized wireflow as well as the variations in layout, typography, shape, and color are present on [this](https://www.figma.com/file/gexS2VV4N2rfExWLMhSoUk/Interface-Design-System---Nathan-Koketsu?type=design&node-id=32%3A12161&t=JMgBrDlSaU4iPgwL-1) page. The file also includes notes regarding the impression tests conducted for the app.

#### Impression Test Link
The link to a video of the second impression test is [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1v1AlS94XAR1jkvvhXcct14oTBxLdBg5d/view?usp=sharing). There are Zoom messages available from the first test, and notes are available on the Figma document.
