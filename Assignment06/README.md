## Assignment 6: Interface Design

Nathan Koketsu | DH 110 | Spring 2023

### Introduction
The goal of this project is to improve communication about dietary restrictions to inform grocery buying as well as organize and expedite the process of forming grocery lists. The app is designed to allow people to connect in a way similar to apps like Venmo while sharing specific information about their specific dietary restrictions. This project is very helpful after creating a wireflow since it allows for further refinement on the visual design side of the website. By trying out different iterations, it is helpful to find the most effective designs.

### Digitized Wireflow and Interface Design Page
The digitized wireflow is present on [this](https://www.figma.com/file/yhxrfdiStRzQVorkyg7KzF/Digitized-Wireflow?type=design&node-id=1%3A9208&t=XYVwyF6TJrmqdG7z-1) page.

The variations in layout, typography, shape, and color are present on [this](https://www.figma.com/file/gexS2VV4N2rfExWLMhSoUk/Interface-Design-System---Nathan-Koketsu?type=design&node-id=32%3A12161&t=JMgBrDlSaU4iPgwL-1) page. The file also includes notes regarding the impression tests conducted for the app.

#### Impression Test Link
The link to a video of the second impression test is [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1v1AlS94XAR1jkvvhXcct14oTBxLdBg5d/view?usp=sharing). There are Zoom messages available from the first test, and notes are available on the Figma document.

#### Final Design Choosing Process
Ultimately, the final design for the interface was chosen based on multiple factors. For example, in choosing the layout, the selected design best separated the different sections of the interface for organizational purposes while creating the most effective guideline for text on the page, as the list boxes only have text on the left-hand side while featuring profile pictures and icons. The chosen typography maximized readibility while including greater uniqueness to the app itself. The shape chosen was the most effective balance between the harshness of sharp corners and the cramped feel of corners that were too rounded. This matched findings from the impression tests. Finally, the color scheme was mainly chosen based on how well the colors matched the theme of the app, as some color schemes seemed less evocative of a grocery list app and related more to other ideas.
