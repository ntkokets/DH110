## Assignment 4: Persona + Scenario

Nathan Koketsu | DH 110 | Spring 2023

### Introduction
In seeking to design a product that aligns with a user's needs and goals, heuristic evaluations, usability testing, and user research help to provide parts of the larger picture. The creation of UX storytelling takes these findings and provides additional context to aid in visualizing potential users of the product. By writing specific scenarios and user personas, we can better conceptualize the realistic needs that the hypothetical product would be able to meet.

The proposed app would aid in users' creation of grocery lists for the purposes of family connection. Thus, members of the target audience will be those who make an effort to involve themselves with their families through food, though this goal is shared by a variety of personas.

### Proposed Tasks (Features)
* **Sharing of Dietary Restrictions:** By creating an account on the app, users can update their individual profiles with their specific dietary restrictions. The app will then allow accounts to "friend" one another, making accounts aware of their friends' dietary restrictions as they might pertain to grocery shopping. This impacts features such as the creation of grocery lists since users can add their friend accounts to the list, allowing the app to automatically compare friends' dietary restrictions to the items on the list. The app's database includes different types of dietary restrictions such as food allergies and vegan, vegetarian, gluten-free, and low-sodium diets.
* **Ingredient Substitute Recommendations:** According to the dietary restrictions attached to a grocery list, either a user's or their friends' restrictions, the app will flag groceries that conflict with these restrictions. When selecting the flagged grocery item for more information, alternative items display to replace the item if desired, including options to imitate the item as well as replacements for its nutritional content.
