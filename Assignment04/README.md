## Assignment 4: Persona + Scenario

### Introduction
In seeking to design a product that aligns with a user's needs and goals, heuristic evaluations, usability testing, and user research help to provide parts of the larger picture. The creation of UX storytelling takes these findings and provides additional context to aid in visualizing potential users of the product. By writing specific scenarios and user personas, we can better conceptualize the realistic needs that the hypothetical product would be able to meet.

The proposed app would aid in users' creation of grocery lists for the purposes of family connection. Thus, members of the target audience will be those who make an effort to involve themselves with their families through food, though this goal is shared by a variety of personas.

### Proposed Tasks (Features)
* **Sharing of Dietary Restrictions:** By creating an account on the app, users can update their individual profiles with their specific dietary restrictions. The app will then allow accounts to "friend" one another, making accounts aware of their friends' dietary restrictions as they might pertain to grocery shopping. This impacts features such as the creation of grocery lists since users can add their friend accounts to the list, allowing the app to automatically compare friends' dietary restrictions to the items on the list. The app's database includes different types of dietary restrictions such as food allergies and vegan, vegetarian, gluten-free, and low-sodium diets.
* **Ingredient Substitute Recommendations:** According to the dietary restrictions attached to a grocery list, either a user's or their friends' restrictions, the app will flag groceries that conflict with these restrictions. When selecting the flagged grocery item for more information, alternative items display to replace the item if desired, including options to imitate the item as well as replacements for its nutritional content.

### Scenarios and Journey Maps

Melissa's Scenario 

> *This scenario will center the ingredient substitution recommendation feature of the proposed app*

At the beginning of the week, Melissa is interested in cooking a new recipe for her family. She is wary of creating a meal that her children will like this time since they didn't finish what was prepared for them last week during dinner. The previous recipe, a pasta casserole with gluten-free pasta and soy-free substitutions for other ingredients, had not only cost more but also tasted noticeably different than the recipe without substitutions. While she reasoned that children do not always like their dinner food, as they are both at middle-school age, she finds that simply trying to replace ingredients with their gluten-free or soy-free equivalents does not usually yield approval from them. The response to the casserole was not an isolated occurrence. 

In talking with her spouse, they were unable to think of good ways to make new recipes while avoiding this problem. For instance, there are many vegetables, meats, and other ingredients that both of her children can eat, and the children like many of them. However, this is a relatively limited list considering that she has been cooking for multiple years and finds herself using this very list in every recipe. Wanting the kids to explore new but healthy options, Melissa is motivated to make new types of cuisine for future meals, but she has felt barred from entire categories. She wants to experiment with new flavors but has become averse to recipes that she cannot seem to make without buying special gluten-free or soy-free substitutions, which she does not prefer.
