</p>
> *The first of these is a recipe book with Korean dishes. While the recipe used in the task was available online, the participant was most familiar with cooking the one in the recipe book. This relates to an overall finding that familiarity is an important component of the participant's experience of completing the task of creating family grocery lists.

> *The second is the Errands To-Do List app, available on the iPhone. While the app has a relatively simple design for performing the specific tasks desired by the participant, he notably created a personal system for using the app that was not built into it.
