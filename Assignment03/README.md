## Assignment 3: Qualitative User Research

Nathan Koketsu | DH 110 | Spring 2023

### Introduction
Through this project, the main activity supported is the interconnectivity between family members through eating together. This fits with a need for love and belonging within the human experience by encouraging a strengthening of family relationships through shared cuisine. Knowing that many families have members with certain dietary restrictions, these restrictions can pose a potential barrier for this type of connection, especially in larger family gatherings where not all members are familiar with each other's dietary needs. While not being able to eat a family member's cooking is not catastrophic, it can easily be a small way of feeling less connected to them.

Currently, the task of creating connection through eating together can be solved by different methods. For example, if family members know that they will need to accommodate certain dietary restrictions, they can buy pre-processed foods that clearly align with these restrictions. However, this can remove the aspect of cooking for one another, making the prepared dish or item lacking in any cultural elements that function within the family. Rather than prepare the dish themselves, family members would be restricted to another company's creation in this case. An alternative solution is to bring simple prepared cuisine such as fruits or vegetables to these gatherings, which can be easier to compare with known dietary restrictions. For instance, if a family member needs to eat low cholesterol and is allergic to nuts, one could prepare fruits and vegetables using simple techniques such as chopping or roasting to match these needs. However, family members may want to prepare more complicated recipes, where the task of accommodating dietary restrictions can be more difficult. These tend to venture beyond short ingredient lists.

Another solution that can apply is to make a known or new recipe with ingredient substitions or omissions. However, even this has limitations. There are some ingredients that may actually break someone's dietary restrictions without the preparer's knowledge. If they want to take extra care, the preparer could research each ingredient individually, but this can prove tedious and would like need to be done repeatedly at successive family gatherings. This process also relies heavily on the preparer's capabilities at research and intuition to be able to know their ingredients well, something that is not true for everyone.

#### Tools used by the participant
For the task of creating family grocery lists, the participant regularly uses the following tools. Even with the more irregular components introduced during the study, the participant's approach still revolved around t

> *The first of these is a recipe book with Korean dishes. While the recipe used in the task was available online, the participant was most familiar with cooking the one in the recipe book. This relates to an overall finding that familiarity is an important component of the participant's experience of completing the task of creating family grocery lists.*

> *The second is the Errands To-Do List app, available on the iPhone. While the app has a relatively simple design for performing the specific tasks desired by the participant, he notably created a personal system for using the app that was not built into it.*


> *Additionally, the participant specified that he would choose to use either text messaging or email apps, whichever works for contacting a specific family member, to clarify their dietary restrictions. This is especially relevant for extended family members the participant does not know as closely and, therefore, has not frequently cooked for. He also mentioned that he would likely use an app such as Google or Safari to learn more about new ingredients for particularly unfamiliar or serious dietary restrictions. Within the confines of this study, where the participant did not have another family member to contact and did not lack familiarity with any of the ingredients applied to solve the task, none of these were ultimately applied toward his solution.*
