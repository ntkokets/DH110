## Assignment 2: Usability Testing (UT)

Nathan Koketsu | DH 110 | Spring 2023

### Introduction
Errands To-Do List is an app that combines checklists, scheduling, alerts, a calendar view, and other features to help users navigate day-to-day tasks, available on both iPad and iPhone for Apple users. It also includes photo and color customization features for the appearance of tasks. In this exercise, we will conduct a usability test of the app, utilizing it to determine ways to improve the app from the user's perspective. From performing heuristic reviews of the app, I found the following issues in the usability of the app:
* When creating tasks, the large number of options featured in the display can make the process overly complicated for users
* Customization settings for text color and display font are difficult to utilize when needed
* Namely when managing large numbers of tasks, the act of moving old tasks into new folders can be tedious
* Some actions, such as viewing all tasks on the app calendar, only have one pathway, which can be inefficient

### Methods
The test was conducted in another student's dormitory room

### Test Materials (Google Form)

### Reflection
During the pilot test, I gained greater insights into a user's experience when using the app from an unfamiliar perspective. Having used the app for a long time, I was curious about a user's reaction to the app without having a knowledge of the symbols or phrases used. I agreed with the participant's comment that the app interface seemed unrefined and often confusing, with some aspects lacking clarification. Through the test, I was also able to hear about the participant's honest thoughts about the app and how they affected their overall experience and assessment of it. The environment was relatively quiet and did not interfere with the test overall, but it was not an ideal location to use for testing since it was difficult for us to interact face-to-face. Had there been a table where both of us were sitting, I could have had a better sense of the participant's body language outside of the Zoom recording we used. Additionally, we needed to sort out issues with the recording medium, where the participant's face was not initially visible, and needed to adjust our recording approach to hear his voice. While the setup of the tasks and navigation of the Google Form worked fine, I would sometimes notice awkward wording within the form and was unsure of my script at times, something which could convey a lack of professionalism in an official setting. 

For the future, I would make sure to review the testing form and media beforehand, using brief test runs to ensure a smooth assessment with a participant. Also, I would practice my script to avoid making slip-ups that might impact the participant's mindset during the test. I noticed that it was difficult to avoid saying anything that could influence the participant's approach to the app, so I would be wary of this when conducting future tests. To gain more of a sense of the participant's individual review of the website, I would ask more follow-up questions about their overall opinion of the site, pairing with the post-test questionnaire.
