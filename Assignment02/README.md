### Reflection
During the pilot test, I gained greater insights into a user's experience when using the app from an unfamiliar perspective. Having used the app for a long time, I was curious about a user's reaction to the app without having a knowledge of the symbols or phrases used. Through the test, I was also able to hear about the participant's honest thoughts about the app and how they affected their overall experience and assessment of it. The environment was relatively quiet and did not interfere with the test overall, but it was not an ideal location to use for testing since it was difficult for us to interact face-to-face. Had there been a table where both of us were sitting, I could have had a better sense of the participant's body language outside of the Zoom recording we used. Additionally, we needed to sort out issues with the recording medium, where the participant's face was not initially visible, and needed to adjust our recording approach to hear his voice. While the setup of the tasks and navigation of the Google Form worked fine, I would sometimes notice awkward wording within the form and was unsure of my script at times, something which could convey a lack of professionalism in an official setting. 

For the future, I would make sure to review the testing form and media beforehand, using brief test runs to ensure a smooth assessment with a participant. Also, I would practice my script to avoid making slip-ups that might impact the participant's mindset during the test. I noticed that it was difficult to avoid saying anything that could influence the participant's approach to the app, so I would be wary of this when conducting future tests.
